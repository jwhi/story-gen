The king took geld from Bath as if it were a 20
hide estate (DB 1.31). He also received £60 in rents
and £5 from the mint and £11 from the proceeds of
‘the third penny’ (a third of the proceeds of justice).
The king had only 64 burgesses there, the abbey 24
and other lords 90. The greater part of rental income
therefore went to the church and to other non-royal
lords. Without the tax revenues the king would have
been a minority ‘shareholder’ in the borough.
